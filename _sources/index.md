==========================================================

Programming for Data Science is an introductory course focused on essential programming concepts, structures, and techniques. Students will develop the skills to write efficient code, as well as to read, understand, and debug it. The course is primarily based on Python and covers its basic and intermediate programming features. Additionally, it introduces some of the fundamental Python libraries for Data Science, namely NumPy and Pandas. Given the importance of R in Data Science, a brief introduction to this language is also included. The course concludes with an introduction to the Command Line and GitHub, two essential tools commonly used by Data Scientists in their daily work.

As most of the code in Python, this book is also organized into a few modules:

- **Module 1: Getting Started** are...
- **Module 2: Python (Essential)** covers ... 
- **Module 3: Python II (Advance)** sections describe...
- **Module 4: Python for Data Science** sections describe...
- **Module 5: R** sections describe...
- **Module 6: Miscelaneous** sections describe...
