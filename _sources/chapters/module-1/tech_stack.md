## Open OnDemand
Open OnDemand is a graphical user interface that allows access to HPC via a web browser.  The Open OnDemand access point is ood.hpc.virginia.edu.  Within the Open OnDemand environment users have access to a file explorer; interactive applications like JupyterLab, RStudio Server & FastX Web; a command line interface; and a job composer and job monitor to submit jobs to the Rivanna and Afton clusters.  Let's have a quick look at their detailed <a href="https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/hpc/ood">documentation</a>

## JupyterLab
In this course we are going to work with **Jupyter notebooks**, which are open-source web applications widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing for writing and sharing documents combining live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. They support multiple programming languages, most notably Python and R, and integrate rich text formatting with Markdown and LaTeX for detailed explanations. Notebooks facilitate interactive coding, enabling step-by-step execution and debugging, and are ideal for visual data analysis. Their portability and support for reproducible research make them a valuable tool in both educational and research settings. You can get familiar to the use of jupyter notebook in our future <a href="jupyter_notebooks.html">lesson</a>.
