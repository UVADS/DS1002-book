    "\n",
    "Python is an **object-oriented** programming (OOP) language. The object-oriented programming is kind of paradigm that helps you group state (attributes) and behavior (methods) together in handy packets of functionality. It also allows for useful specialized mechanisms such as inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that python is an OOP language does not mean you are force to follow this paradigm (unlike some other OOP languages). You can still do procedural programming as we have learned so far, with modules and functions. In Python, you can select the paradigm that fits best for your your purposes, or even mix paradigms.\n",

    "## 1. Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classes** help describe/model data structures, or collections of functions centered on a particular set of tasks related to a particular type of data. A class is much like a template or schema. Classes may, but does not have to, take parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attributes** - values/fields specific to each instance of a class.\n",
    "- **Methods** - functions available within and specific to a class. Methods may consume attributes or other parameters.\n",
    "- **Constructors** - the attribute structure/default values of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instances** / **Objects** are actual, concrete implementations of a class with specific values.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"OO is about grouping DATA with the FUNCTIONS that manipulate that data and hiding HOW it manipulates it so you can MODIFY the behavior through INHERITANCE.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of OOP programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MAINTAINABILITY** Object-oriented programming methods make code more maintainable. Identifying the source of errors is easier because objects are self-contained.\n",
    "- **REUSABILITY** Because objects contain both data and methods that act on data, objects can be thought of as self-contained black boxes. This feature makes it easy to reuse code in new systems.Messages provide a predefined interface to an object's data and functionality. With this interface, an object can be used in any context.\n",
    "- **SCALABILITY** Object-oriented programs are also scalable. As an object's interface provides a road map for reusing the object in new software, and provides all the information needed to replace the object without affecting other code. This way aging code can be replaced with faster algorithms and newer technology."
