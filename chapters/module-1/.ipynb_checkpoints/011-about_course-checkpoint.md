# Introduction

Programming for Data Science is an introductory course focused on essential programming concepts, structures, and techniques. Students will develop the skills to write efficient code, as well as to read, understand, and debug it. The course is primarily based on Python and covers its basic and intermediate programming features. Additionally, it introduces some of the fundamental Python libraries for Data Science, namely NumPy and Pandas. Given the importance of R in Data Science, a brief introduction to this language is also included. The course concludes with an introduction to the Command Line and GitHub, two essential tools commonly used by Data Scientists in their daily work.

# Learning Objectives

Understand the importance of programming for data science.
Confidently work in one of the most commons programming environment for Data Science: Jupyter Notebooks.
Identify and use data types and data structures.
Read and write to and from various data formats.
Confidently call and write functions and methods.
Introduction to Object Oriented Programming.
Use and develop your own modules and packages to encapsulate and efficiently organize the code.

# How You Will Know You Are Learning

This course will be a combination of mini-lectures and in-class interactive coding. During all class sessions, you should expect to be following along on your device (e.g. code walks). During interactive coding sessions, you should expect to spend your time on your computer working through problems. The best way to become comfortable with the material is to continually practice. The idea by making this active learning class is that you can practice in an environment where you can ask questions and trouble-shoot. Working in small groups is recommendable. Every class won't go perfectly, but week after week you should be more comfortable with the material.# Introduction

This course exposes students to fundamental coding languages and techniques in data science. Python and R are the primary focus of the course. Popular packages such as pandas and tidyverse will be covered as well as how to write modular, reusable code. Additionally, software management skills such as Git and Github will be covered.

For students new to programming of any kind, this will be an introduction to working with the basic operations and data structures of two languages common to Data Science. We will also discuss and practice good habits around software development and management. As you will learn, there are several other pieces "around" the coding process to learn, such as setting up and working within different environments, source control using tools like git, and working with various types of data. These will be essential to our work in Python and R, and will undoubtedly serve you will in future courses.

Successful students will be able to approach fundamental data science tasks programmatically including data capture, cleaning, manipulation, and visualization with confidence and efficiency.

## How will you succeed in this course?

**Participate.** You are expected to participate actively in the course based on your own learning goals. Since you all come from different backgrounds and experiences of data science, your peers are valuable resources for learning. Don’t shortchange them and yourself by coming to class without preparing or by sitting quietly during class discussion.

**Communicate.** This course may be unlike any of your previous courses, with increasingly complex content and new kinds of technical challenges. I am committed to helping you address these new challenges, and therefore have an open door policy in addition to class and office hours; I will meet with you or respond to your email within 24 hours whenever possible. You should let me know what ideas and tools are challenging to you and how you are doing in the class. If you start this habit early in the semester, then I will be able to better tailor our activities to help you learn. If you’re not comfortable with email or office hours, then post a comment in Anonymous Feedback in the class Canvas site.

**Take risks.** Programming often requires personal judgments about what to include or ignore, which structural approach to follow, and/or how to interpret complex data. Sometimes the “right” answer is unknown, incomplete, or even wrong! Nobel Prize breakthroughs have often resulted from attempting to support a “best guess” with incomplete data or from finding evidence to explain an “experiment gone wrong.” You will be rewarded for going out on a limb to defend your ideas as long as your assumptions and decision‐making process are transparent in your answers. If you’re not sure how to start a problem, don’t be scared to defend your assumptions and go for it!
